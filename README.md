# ⚡🐹 Pokémon Platinum Pygame 🕹️


This is a hobby project that I started working on in August 2025. My goal is to learn about game development with Python by recreating the starting area of the game.
Currently, the player can only walk in the starting town. Colliders are also calculated and drawn but not yet functional.
This is still a work in progress but I hope to finish it once I have more time.
